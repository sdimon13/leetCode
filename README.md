# [LeetCode Solutions](https://github.com/sdimon13/leetCode)

Leetcode is a website containing many **algorithm questions**. Most of them are real interview questions of **Google,
Facebook,
LinkedIn, Apple**, etc. and it always help to sharp our algorithm Skills. Level up your coding skills and quickly land a
job. This is the best place to expand your knowledge and get prepared for your next interview. This repo shows my
solutions in Go with the code style strictly follows
the [Google Golang Style Guide](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments). Please feel free to reference and
